This is the source code of the SIGMOD'21 paper "Query-by-Sketch: Scaling Shortest Path Graph Queries on Very Large Graphs".


PathPPL and ParentPPL are for 2-hop path cover.

preprocess is designed for all kinds of graphs. It cleans the data by removing duplicated edges, sorting vertices according to degrees and sorting edges according to degrees.
sparsify is designed for files generated by preprocess. It sparsifies the graph by removing edges adjacent to landmarks (top-k vertices).
